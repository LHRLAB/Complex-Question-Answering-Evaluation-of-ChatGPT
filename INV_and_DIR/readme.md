# Introduction

This repository serves as a record of the results generated during the invariance test and directional expectation test experiments we conducted on the KQApro dataset. We chose to primarily focus our experiments on the KQApro dataset because it contains all the necessary types of data we required.  

We hope that these experimental results will be useful for researchers and developers working on open-domain complex question answering models, and that this repository will provide a valuable resource for evaluating and improving those models.  

Please feel free to use the data contained in this repository for your own experiments and research purposes. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
